# 0. Sun Microsystems

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems

American technology company founded February 24, 1982, and existed until 2010. It was traded on Nasdaq as SUNW between 1986 and 2007, and JAVA between 2007 and 2010.

The company contributed to key technologies: Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing.

The company was based in Santa Clara, California on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.

# 1. Agnews Developmental Center

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnews_Developmental_Center

The center was made in 1885 and was originally known as "The Great Asylum for the Insane". The main, red brick structure was located near Agnew's Village. 

The building was modeled after the Kirkbride Plan and designed by Theodore Lenzen.

Frederick W. Hatch was elected as the Superintendent of Agnews Insane Asylum from the Fall of 1889 until 1897. 

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused the destruction of the facility and nearby buildings. 117 patients and staff were killed and buries in mass graves on the site. The Daily Palo Alto reported: "The position of the people in Agnews is critical; a number of insane persons having escaped from the demolished asylum are running at random about the country."

Agnews was rebuilt in the Mediterranean Revival architecture styles of Missing Reviva - Spanish Colonial Revival. It re-opened circa 1911 as Agnews State Mental Hospital. 

In 1926 the center was expanded to include a second campus about 2 miles to the east on Zanker road in San Jose. A hospital was later built for said campus in the early 1960s.

# 2. Agnews Village 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnew%27s_Village,_California

Angew was named for Abram Agnew, a pioneer from Ohio who settled circa 1873. 

Agnew's land appears on 1877 maps, opposite Lick Mill, a paper mill operated by James Lick. 

The campus has been turned into the Rivermark community and a Research & Development campus for Oracle Corporation.

# 2. Kirkbride Plan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkbride_Plan

The Kirkbride Plan was a system of mental asylum design advocated by American psychiatrist Thomas Story Kirkbride (1809-1883). Asylums built in the Kirkbride design are referred to as Kirkbride Buildings or Kirkbrides. 

Hospitals built according to the Kirkbride Plan would adopt various architectural styles, but had in common the "bat wing" style floor plan, housing numerous wings that sprawl outward from the center.  

## Motivation

The establishment of state mental hospitals in the U.S. was partly due to reformer Dorothea Dix, who testified to the New Jersey legislature in 1844 describing the state's treatment of lunatics (housed in county jails, private homes, and the basements of public buildings).

Dix's effort led to the construction of the New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum, the first complete asylum built on the Kirkbride Plan.

Thomas Story Kirkbride developed his asylum requirements based on a philosophy of Moral Treatment and environmental determinism.

## Operations

Kirkbride outlined how a hospital should be staffed and operated on a daily basis.

Among the staff of a Kirkbride Plan hospital were the superintending physician, an assisting physician and nurses, supervisors and teachers of each sex, a chaplain, matron, and a nightwatchman. 

Kirkbride urged that at least two attendants be working in each ward at any given time, and stressed the importance of the superintendent's "proper selection" of attendants, given the extent of their management responsibilities. "The duties of attendants, when faithfully performed, are often harassing, and in many wards, among excited patients, are peculiarly so. On this account pains should always be taken to give them a reasonable amount of relaxation and their position should, in every respect, be made as comfortable as possible."

For general labor at the hospital, he suggested that the able-minded patients help maintain the hospital grounds and assist in duties in their respective wards. 

"Although in a few institutions a liberal compensation is given, in many, the salaries are quite too low, and entirely inadequate to be depended on, to secure and retain the best kind of talent for the different positions. The services required about the insane, when faithfully performed, are peculiarly trying to the mental and physical powers of any individual, and ought to be liberally paid for."

# 3. Thomas Story Kirkbride

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Story_Kirkbride

Thomas Story Kirkbride (July 31, 1809 - December 16, 1883) was a physician, alienist (archaism for psychiatrist), and hospital superintendend for the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital. He was the primary founder of the Association of Medical Superintendents of American Instutions for the Insane, the organizational precursor to the American Psychiatric Association. Alongside Benjamin Rush, he is considered to be the father of the modern American practice of psychiatry as a specific medical discipline.

Kirkbride was born into a wealthy Orthodox Quaker family. He was the son of John Kirkbride and Elizabeth Story. His younger sister was Rachel Story Kirkbride. 

# 3. Moral Treatment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_treatment

An approach to mental disorder based on humane psychosocial care or moral discipline that emerged in the 18th century.

Moral treatment developed in the context of Enlightenment and its focus on social welfare and individual rights. At the start of the 18th century, the insane were viewed as wild animals who had lost their reason. They were subject to scorn and ridicule by the public, often kept in chains and neglected or subject to numerous torturous treatments including whipping, beating, bloodletting, shocking, starvation, irritant chemicals, and isolation. 

In England, John Locke popularized the idea that there is a degree of madness in most people because emotions can cause people to incorrectly associate ideas and perceptions. William Battie suggested a more psychological approach.

The treatment of King George III led to increased optimism about the possibility of therapeutic interventions.

# 4. King George III

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III

George III (George William Frederick; 4 une 1738 - 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 until his death in 1820. 

The Acts of Union 1800 unified Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with George as its king.

He was concurrently duke and prince-elector of Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. 

In 1761 he married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and had 15 children.

Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. Britain lost 13 of its North American colonies in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. 

In 1807 the transatlatnic slave trade was banned from the British Empire. 

His religious education was wholly Anglican. 

# 5. Anglicanism 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism

Anglicanism forms a branch of Western Christianity, having declared its independence from the Holy See (also called the See of Rome, the Petrine See, or the Apostolic See) through the Act of Supremacy in 1534. 

# 1. RISC

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer

Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a computer architecture designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the compuer to accomplish tasks. 

RISC may require more instructions than a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) because the individual instructions perform simpler operations. The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline. 

The key operational concept of the RISC computer is that each instruction performs only one function. The RISC computer has many (16 or 32) high-speed, general-purpose registers with a load-store architecture in which the instructions that perform arithmetic and tests operate only on the registers, and the instructions that access data in the main memory of the computer only load data from memory into registers or store data from registers into memory. The design allows predictable instruction times that simplify the design of the systems as a whole.

Apple chairman John Sculley said "Hypercard opens up the Macintosh software environment in much the way the Macintosh II opened up Mac hardware". It and MultiFinder, also announced at Macworld, would be bundled with new Macs, and $49 each for existing customers.

HyperCard runs natively only in the classic Mac OS, but it can still be used in Mac OS X's Classic mode on PowerPC based machines (G5 and earlier). The last functional native HyperCard authoring environment is Classic mode in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) on PowerPC-based machines.
