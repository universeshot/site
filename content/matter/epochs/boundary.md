# Boundary

An epoch boundary occurs when such a significant development occurs that it fundamentally shifts the way humanity as a whole will operate.

People often witness these epoch boundaries through major global events. Some make the boundaries obvious, like the dot com bubble and the advent of generally available websites. Some obscur the boundary's implications, like World War II and the advent of computing as a whole. 

# Computing Boundaries

Every boundary in existence is, to some extent, a computing boundary. Any development changes the way "something" is processed and so can be considered as a computing boundary.

World War II was the most significant computing boundary owing to the following mass electronification of every field known to man. 

Whenever new electronic solutions become available, whatever previous technology is often declared obseleted, and either recycled or destroyed.

Before electronic equivalents, humans were the most effective computers available. To that extent, some might think the value of humans themselves changed at the turn of the epoch. Given the known-impending shift in technology, some might argue that the holocaust was not targeting any specific group and was instead an attempt to determine human bucketization masquerading as a race-driven genocide. The easiest way to validate such a theory would be to see an equivalent repeat in effort to accurately determine human bucketization. 

# Past Boundary

Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and the blockchain as a whole was passed over as a new mechanism to manage currency and assets. The reality is that the technology marked a much more important shift: a generally available description of effective, efficient data storage, simple enough that any layman should be able to easily understand it. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper focuses on currency, but the fundamentals apply so broadly that they can be seen in any field. In fact, the nature of history itself relies on the same fundamentals that Bitcoin employs to bring about a novel shift in technology.

Even though the shift in humanity has not been fully observed yet, there is almost no doubt that the future of computing, currency, and data will rely on blockchain-based implementations. 

Given the shift will be more focused on the implementation than the end-user experience, this could be considered a mini-boundary - it is not on the same scale as the boundary observed during World War II. 

# Next Boundary

Gen AI is already well known to be shaping the future of technology.
