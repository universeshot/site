# Obfuscation

Obfuscation is the act of making something unclear or unintelligible.

This may make it seem as though any end-result is not comprehensible, but that is not always the case. The only requirement is that the original intention is no longer apparent. 

One reason to obfuscate something is to hide the presence of something. This would be important if the thing present was illegal, immoral, or would otherwise attract unwanted negative attention.

Another reason is to retain ownership and control without explicitly declaring it. This would be important if something had privately-known guaranteed developments inbound, despite publicly stated uncertainty. Given the strict rules around what is patentable, the most likely successful approach for any development initiative is to be the first to market. By obfuscating the truth around whatever development already exists, the very first trailblazers within a field should be able to retain full control.

# Language

The first layer of obfuscation in anything is the language used when presenting it to the world. For anything to maintain relevance in modern computing, it required success in the American domestic market. So, the English language was used for almost everything to do with development for modern computing. 

# Two Steps Ahead

Assuming that the pioneers of modern computing were able to see two steps ahead, they should have been able to anticipate what will come until now and likely some distance into the future. Most of modern computing is a solved problem, though future developments have been obfuscated for reasons unrelated to electronic computers. 

The current major breakthrough in computing is Gen AI. Gen AI may be trained natively in any language, but that is not a requirement for using Gen AI in any language. Translation tools have been around for years already, and even if Gen AI were only available in English it is a near-trivial task to translate any input to English before passing it to a Gen AI agent. 

Knowing that concrete tasks like language translation would become trivial, any pioneer wanting to gatekeep would know that language alone is not enough to hide any secrets in development.
