Welcome to Universe Shot. We see modern computing as a constellation of fast-moving forces: new interfaces, automation, distributed teams, and volatile markets. Our job is to build the instruments that keep you pointed toward what matters.

We'll share patterns, experiments, and releases here in the Observatory. Thanks for visiting.
