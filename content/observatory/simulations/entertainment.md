# Entertainment

At our level, we play games like Basell and Overwatch, and enjoy visual media like K-Dramas and Anime. 

But what if that gets boring? Well, that doesn't mean the entertainment is bad, it just means the user is no longer satisfied by the provided stimulation. So it may be important to understand stimulation itself before deciding what to do next.

Entertainment has already existed for an eternity. So, entertainment would have evolved before stimulation itself was well understood. That is hopefully used to explain what may be considered more sadistic entertainment.

Sadistic entertainment meaning: entertainment at the expense of people - through their suffering, or humiliation. 

Pushing past your limits does not imply the requirement of suffering - many will find the outcome worth the required pain in this scenario. Equally, an audience does not imply the requirement of humiliation - confidence, ability, and control shape the difference between humiliation or not. 

Suffering implies pain or torment that is not otherwise required or wanted by the person experiencing it. Humiliation implies forcibly and publicly disrespect someone.

So what other entertainment might there be? Consider the "dark side" of the world. This side of the world might partake in things like:
1. Betting on people (dating, marriage, employment, anything in a person's life that is not guaranteed and certain)
2. Betting on "races" (races that may be considered illegal except for the fact there is no public declaration that these races are taking place)
3. Oppression (or, preventing incumbent competition) (used to entertain those who enjoy watching others struggle)
